# Secure Messaging Application

This project is a secure messaging application that ensures end-to-end encryption for user communications. It allows users to send encrypted messages securely over the internet.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted on the sender's device and decrypted on the receiver's device, ensuring privacy.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login processes using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Real-time Messaging**: Send and receive messages in real-time.
- **Simple UI**: Minimalist and user-friendly interface for messaging.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Encryption**: CryptoJS (AES-256)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
